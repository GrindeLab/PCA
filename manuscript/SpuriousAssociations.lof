Suppose that, instead of genome-wide global ancestry ($\pi $), a principal component ($z$) captures the genotype of two variants ($g_1, g_2$). If one of those variants ($g_1$) is associated with the trait, then the PC will be a collider variable---rather than a confounding variable---when testing the association between the other variant ($g_2$) and the trait. Adjusting for the PC will then induce a spurious association between the trait and the neutral variant as a result of collider bias.}}{47}{figure.8}%
