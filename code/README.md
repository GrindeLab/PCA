# Code Example

Here we provide an overview of the steps taken to run PCA in whole genome sequence data.
This code leans heavily on the University of Washington Genetic Analysis Center's TOPMed Analysis Pipeline: https://github.com/UW-GAC/analysis_pipeline.

The analysis can be broken into five steps:

1. Filter
2. Convert VCF to GDS
3. Find unrelated samples
4. Run ADMIXTURE
5. Run PCA

## Step 1: Filter

## Step 2: VCF to GDS

## Step 3: Unrelated

## Step 4: ADMIXTURE

## Step 5: PCA
